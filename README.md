# Photo Reducer with QT GUI 

This project is created using only C++ code, QT Creator is not used except to generate the project and CMake files themselves.  en

The basic controls and actions are the same as the [GUI Photo Reduction Tool](https://github.com/pacmaninbw/GUIPhotoReductionTool), but rather than use QT Creator to create the main window and the options dialog the code is all written by the developer. I found I wasn't learning enough about QT development by using QT Creator.  

## Goals  
The primary goal of this project is to learn QT 6.  

A secondary goal is to be able to implement the Model View Controller design pattern in QT using C++.

# Development Environment  
 - Ubuntu 22.04  
 - Visual Studio Code  
 - C++ 23  
 - gcc 12  
 - QT 6.8

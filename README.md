# Photo Reducer with QT GUI 

This project is created using only C++ code, QT Creator is not used except to generate the project and CMake files themselves.  en

The basic controls and actions are the same as the [GUI Photo Reduction Tool](https://github.com/pacmaninbw/GUIPhotoReductionTool), but rather than use QT Creator to create the main window and the options dialog the code is all written by the developer. I found I wasn't learning enough about QT development by using QT Creator.
